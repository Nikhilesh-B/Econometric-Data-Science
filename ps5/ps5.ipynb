    "a. True, we saw in class that these two methods for regressing are the exact same. Basically both methods rely on the same entity comparisons, either you exolicitly estimate each entity's intercpt with dummies or you subtract each entity's average upfront, the slope will only measure the within entity-level deviations over all entities from their own means, so they should be the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. True, the role of the time fixed effects variable captures effects that are specific to a certain period but across all entities in the panel regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. False, if there is no intercept present you would not have to drop one of the dummy variables that is because no multicollinearity only occurs when there is a dummy and an intercept term in the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. False, since distance doesn't change for a country through time if you include fixed effects for a country it will be included in the fixed effect, and therefore you can't estimate the effect of a time-invariant regressor like distance."

I would prefer regression 4 because you can see that the joint f-test for the new variables in regression 5 has a p-value of 0.15, which is not significant. Hence we should choose regression 5.  \n",

    "e. An example of an ommitted variable that is controlled by time fixed effects could be something along the lines of the levels of interest rates that are fixed for all states on a national level at a specific time. This would be correlated with the unemployment rate (generally lower IRs mean lower inflation) and also potentially correlated with the share of votes the incumbents get (if IRs are too high you may want to change the government to lower them)\n",

    "f. An example of an omitted variable that is controlled by entity fixed effects could be share of agircultural jobs. Maybe some states have a certain share of agricultural jobs and this is correlated with unemployment rate but also could be correlated with the share of votes incumbments get (maybe folks with agircultural jobs are always dissatisfied and want to vote the ruling party out).\n",
